# IntelliTerm: The Natural Language Terminal 🚀

IntelliTerm is a smart command-line interface that allows you to execute shell commands by typing in plain English. Powered by the Groq API, it translates natural language requests into executable commands for both Windows (CMD) and Unix-like systems (Bash).

This project was developed as a practical application of concepts from an Operating Systems course, focusing on the shell, process management, and user-computer interaction.

## 🌟 Features

  * **Natural Language Processing**: Simply type what you want to do, like "create a new folder called 'docs'".
  * **Cross-Platform Support**: Automatically detects your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and generates the appropriate command.
  * **Interactive Confirmation**: A built-in safety feature prompts you for confirmation before executing any command.
  * **Clarification Handling**: If your request is ambiguous, the AI will ask for the information it needs to proceed.
  * **Built-in `cd` Handling**: Correctly handles directory changes, a common challenge in custom shells.

-----

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Python 3**
  * **Groq API** for fast Language Model inference.
  * Standard Libraries: `os`, `platform`, `subprocess`, `json`

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get IntelliTerm running on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IntelliTerm.git
cd IntelliTerm
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install groq
```

### 3\. Configure API Key

You need a Groq API key to use the service.

1.  Get your free API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
2.  **(Recommended)** Set the key as an environment variable named `GROQ_API_KEY`.
3.  Alternatively, you can hardcode the key by replacing `"gsk_..."` in the script, but this is not recommended for public repositories.

## ▶️ How to Run

Once you have completed the setup, run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python intelliterm.py
```

The application will start, and you can begin typing commands in natural language.

## 📝 Example Usage

Here are a few examples of how you can interact with IntelliTerm:

**Example 1: Creating a file**

```
C:\Users\You\Desktop> create a text file named notes
Command: `type nul > notes.txt`
What will happen: This command creates a new, empty file named 'notes.txt'.

Press Enter to execute, or Ctrl+C to cancel...
```

**Example 2: Listing files**

```
C:\Users\You\Desktop> show me all the files here
Command: `dir`
What will happen: This command lists all files and directories in the current folder.

Press Enter to execute, or Ctrl+C to cancel...
```

**Example 3: Handling Ambiguity**

```
C:\Users\You\Desktop> open the python file
AI: Which Python file would you like to open? > my_script.py
Command: `code my_script.py`
What will happen: This command opens the file 'my_script.py' in Visual Studio Code.

Press Enter to execute, or Ctrl+C to cancel...
```

## 💡 Future Improvements

  * **Command History**: Implement up/down arrow functionality to cycle through previous commands.
  * **Alias Support**: Allow users to define their own custom shortcuts.
  * **Tab Completion**: Add auto-completion for file and directory names.
